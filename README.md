Hi, I'm Michael Avrukin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mavrukin/) an Engineering Manager of sorts.

This is where I aim to share my knowledge on how to think about coding in various languages, tools, 
and environments in the hopes that others can learn from my experience.

The first area will be C using the famous K&R book as a foundation, jumping off straight into Chapter 4
and going into the interesting parts around software engineering and software design fundamentals.

I expect to move on to Python and building web applications, tools, and data modeling / science 
applications from there.  Hope you enjoy this content.

It will also have companion videos which you can see here (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEwBPcytJRl2r6qkVf3uUg)
